# libraries
This repository is to save and share my libraries for AVR and ARM

There you can find some libraries for AVR and ATMega such as, ATMega328, ATMega2560, Wiced, and STM32 (also can use to ATMega328 and family with a little modifications). You can find some communication protocols; SPI, I2C, UART, etc; special register like ADC, PWM, TIMER, and some sensors like MPU6050, resistive panel, etc.
